Since the acceleration is the second derivative of the position (or the first derivative of the velocity), then differential equations of second (first) order are expected for the position (velocity). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the question is: How to compute the position or velocity as functions of time, given a set of forces acting on a body? For some cases, solutions can be found theoretically. But many cases cannot be solved closely and require a numerical procedure. Typically, time is split in small time-steps of size $\\delta t$, and people tend to apply numerical methods like Runge-Kutta to integrate differential equations and obtain position or velocity at each time step. This is okay for few particles. But, when you have a large system with many interacting particles, Runge-Kutta can be computationally costly since it requires calling the force computation routine several times per time step, with no important increase in precision. There are better approaches for many particles systems, like using Verlet or Leap-Frog integration algorithms. In the following, we will explore the leap-frog algorithm. \n"
