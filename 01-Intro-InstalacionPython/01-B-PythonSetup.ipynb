    "## How to install python packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing python packages can be a nightmare. The first advice is to NOT install packages (using any tool) at the root system level (something like running `sudo pip install ...`). That will create problems when some dependencies are colliding across differetn packages that you need. You could try to install packages using your local account `pip install --user ...`, but the collisions and dependency hell will come sooner than later. The recommended way right now is to use virtual enviroments, which isolate any package installatio across environments. Basically, a virtual env is a directory, tipically called `.env`, inside a given directory, that has all the packages installed on the virtual env and, when activated, those packages will have preference over the system ones. To create a virtual env with pure python, first tou go to the directory where you want it (`/tmp/example` in this case)\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "cd /tmp/example\n",
    "```\n",
    "and then you can run\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "python -m venv .venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That will create a hidden dir, `.venv`, which will contain all the modules installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To activate the venv, use\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "source .venv/bin/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will prepend `.venv/bin` to the path. To deactivate it, just run `deactivate`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have activated a venv, you can use `pip` ito install packages, either from the package name or from a `requirements.txt` file, and all those packages will be isolated from any otrhe installation. You can have as many venv as you want, just don't forget to activate/activate the one you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use conda, you can also create vens using something like\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "conda create -n fenicsproject -c conda-forge fenics\n",
    "source activate fenicsproject \n",
    "```\n",

    "### A very fast solution: using uv\n",
    "Very recently, astral released uv 1.0, https://docs.astral.sh/uv/ , which replaces pip, potery, virtualenv, and so on, and is very very fast. \n",
    "\n",

    "From: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing uv is very easy, and you can use it to create virtual envs easily as shown in https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments/ . You can even use different python versions. And when installing packages, you will be amazed by the speed of uv. Go try it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For using uv in a Dockerfile, check https://mkennedy.codes/posts/python-docker-images-using-uv-s-new-python-features/\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing packages: besides python\n",
    "<img src=\"https://pixi.sh/latest/assets/pixi.webp\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Although conda can be used to install packages that are not related to python, recently there is a solution called pixi, https://pixi.sh/latest/ , that can be used to install packages locally or at the system level. Go read https://pixi.sh/latest/basic_usage/ . \n",
    "\n",
